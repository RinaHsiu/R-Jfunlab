# R-Jfunlab

## Objectives
in this repository, we will start a new journey of coding and fun! there are 3 objectives; 
1.  to play micro:bit programs as many as possible, not only make each program work but also explore the code behind it especially for Python.
2.  we will be a creator of a book called 'the summer journey to china' in which there are description of my trip with my mum and by using ai tools to generate the pictures and maybe some sounds and videos too.
3.  we will build a website for the harewood villiage to introduce this community and neighbourhood.
  
   
the time frame for micro:bit and khanAcademy will be from the 23rd of october to the 6th of january 2025 (my christmas holiday)
the next time frame for website of HarewoodVillage will be from Christmas to Chinese New Year.
the thrid time frame of New Year to Easter Holiday will focus on [xxxx].

our team members are me and my dad jason

## 31/jan/2025 20th Day:

### what we learned today?
- **khanacademy**
  - Unit 3, lesson 1, Challenge, Avatar generator
    - **Functions**
      - a function is like a mini-program inside your program.
      - it's a block of code designed to do a specific task.
      - it's like a recipe: you need to give it ingredients(inputs), it follows the steps(code), and the it created a yummy dish(output)!
      - Functions organise codes and makes it reusable and keeps things tidy.
      - you must have def in front of each function
    - **Define**
      - General meaning
        - give a definition for the meaning of a word
        - determine th essential quality of
      - coding
        - it's used to tell the computer, "Hey, I'm about to define a function!"
        - when we use def, we're signaling the start of a function definition
        - it helps the computer understand that what follows is the name of the function, any parameter it might take, and the block of code the makes up the function.
    - **Parameters**
      - they are like the special ingredients in a function
      - when you define a function,you can specify parameters unside the parentheses(brackest)
      - these parameters act like place holders for the actual values(called arguments) that you'll provide when you call the function
      - this way, the function can perform it's task using the different unputs each time
      - there could be as many parameters as needed with the minimun amout at 0
      - for example, if you have a function to make a sandwich, a parameter could be the type of bread you want
      - you could choose the type when you call the function so it will make the sandwich with your prefered type of bread
    - **DRY**
      - **D**on't
      - **R**epeat
      - **Y**ourself    
    - **def play_piano(time):**
