## Objectives
in this repository, we will start a new journey of coding and fun! there are 3 objectives; 
1.  to play micro:bit programs as many as possible, not only make each program work but also explore the code behind it especially for Python.
2.  we will be a creator of a book called 'the summer journey to china' in which there are description of my trip with my mum and by using ai tools to generate the pictures and maybe some sounds and videos too.
3.  we will build a website for the harewood villiage to introduce this community and neighbourhood.
