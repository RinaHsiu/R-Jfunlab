 # R-Jfunlab

## Objectives
in this repository, we will start a new journey of coding and fun! there are 3 objectives; 
1.  to play micro:bit programs as many as possible, not only make each program work but also explore the code behind it especially for Python.
2.  we will be a creator of a book called 'the summer journey to china' in which there are description of my trip with my mum and by using ai tools to generate the pictures and maybe some sounds and videos too.
3.  we will build a website for the harewood villiage to introduce this community and neighbourhood.
  
   
the time frame for micro:bit and khanAcademy will be from the 23rd of october to the 6th of january 2025 (my christmas holiday)
the next time frame for website of HarewoodVillage will be from Christmas to Chinese New Year.
the thrid time frame of New Year to Easter Holiday will focus on [xxxx].

## 31/jan/2025 20th Day:

### what we learned today?
- **khanacademy**
  - Unit 3, lesson 1, Challenge, Avatar generator
    - **Functions**
      - a function is like a mini-program inside your program.
      - it's a block of code designed to do a specific task.
      - it's like a recipe: you need to give it ingredients(inputs), it follows the steps(code), and the it created a yummy dish(output)!
      - Functions organise codes and makes it reusable and keeps things tidy.
      - you must have def in front of each function
    - **Define**
      - General meaning
        - give a definition for the meaning of a word
        - determine th essential quality of
      - coding
        - it's used to tell the computer, "Hey, I'm about to define a function!"
        - when we use def, we're signaling the start of a function definition
        - it helps the computer understand that what follows is the name of the function, any parameter it might take, and the block of code the makes up the function.
    - **Parameters**
      - they are like the special ingredients in a function
      - when you define a function,you can specify parameters unside the parentheses(brackest)
      - these parameters act like place holders for the actual values(called arguments) that you'll provide when you call the function
      - this way, the function can perform it's task using the different unputs each time
      - there could be as many parameters as needed with the minimun amout at 0
      - for example, if you have a function to make a sandwich, a parameter could be the type of bread you want
      - you could choose the type when you call the function so it will make the sandwich with your prefered type of bread
    - **DRY**
      - **D**on't
      - **R**epeat
      - **Y**ourself    
    - **def play_piano(time):**

### what are my feelings

## 1/Feb/2025 21st Day:

### what we learned today?
- **ebook**
  - what functions are and actually understanding them
  - what functions, parameters and call is in chinese
- **khanacademy**
  - challenge finished
  - while
  - loops
  - *intialise*
    - means to set a starting value for a variable before using it in a program
    - in the context of a while loop, it's important to inialize the loop variable so the loop can function correctly
    - if you don't, it will go on forever
  - *infinite loop*
    - when a loop never ends
  - start, stop, update
    
### what are my feelings
- tired
- happy cuase of stickes
- brain already exploded
- not wanting to aswer dad's annoying questions
  
### next actions
- find something to do other that khanacademy
- more khanacademy

## 02/Feb/2025 22nd Day:

### what we learned today?
- **khanacademy**
  - Iteration
    - iteration means doing something over again
    - in loops, it's each time the loop runs
  - += operator
    - the += operator adds a number to a variable and then updates the variable with the new value
    - it's a shortcut
    - this same way can be used for minus, multiply and divide by using -=, *= and /=
  - challenge
    - used the while operator for the first time 

### what are my feelings
- tired
- thirsty
- need the toilet
- don't want to go to bed
- happy cause i got 1 sticker
  
### next actions

- more khanacademy
  
---

## 7/Feb/2025 23rd Day:

### what we learned today?
- **khanacademy**
  - chalenge done!
  - for loops
    - a for loop is like a while loop but simplified to make things quicker
    - instead of having to write the variable outside of the loop, you just need to write it between the **for** and the **it**
    - all for loops can be while loops but not all while loops can be for loops
    - e.g
      - pattern = 0
        while pattern < 5:
          print("hi")
          print("hi")
          pattern = pattern+1
      - for pattern in range(5):
          print("hi")
          print("hi")
        

### what are my feelings
- tired but dont want to go to bed
- thirsty
- have a headache but not from this sesson
- a bit sad cuase i only got **2** stickers today
- happy cause mum's back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  
### next actions
- more khanacademy
- job for dad: find something similar to catroller but a bit more challenging for next time


---



## 09/Feb/2025 24th Day:

### what we learned today?
- **Khanacademy**
  - range(start, stop, step)
    - the range function helps you create a sequence of numbers using start, stop, step.
    - stop is when the for loop starts
    - start is the number the sequence starts at
    - step is how much the sequence increases
    - if you only put one thing in the parenthesis, the computer will count it as stop
  - Q:is there any for loops without using range or list?
  - A: yes, there are many for loops using different things like; **strings , tuples, dictionaries, sets and files** but we will learn about those later
  - inclusive & exclusive
    - in range, the start is inclusive, meaning it's included in the sequence and the stop is exclusive, meaning it's not included in the sequence.
    - range(1,5) will show as 1, 2, 3, 4.
    - you will notice that there is not 5.
    - this is because 5 is the stop and the stop is exclusive
    - if we wanted to include the 5 in our sequence, we would have to write rang(1,6)

### what are my feelings
- tired
- ready to go to bed
- nervous for physics test tomorrow
- happy because i got stickers!!!!!!!! :)
- still waiting impatiantly for dad to find something like catroller or bitty but a bit more challenging
  
### next actions
- do the challenge on khanacademy
- hopefully be able to do the new thingthat dad will find by next week
- more khanacademy

## 24&27/Feb/2025 25th Day:

### what we learned today?
- **khanacademy**
- min(hfaksjhfkdjshfkasjdhfkasjdhfkjdsfh)
  - in python, min is used to choose the smaller number of a group of numbers given.
  - for example
  - min(3,1,4) would return 1 as it is the smallest one out of the numbers
- max(hfoahskjfhaksjfhkajshf)
  - in python, max is the opposite of min.
  - instead of choosinf the smallest number of a group of numbers, it would choose the greatest.
  - for example
  - max(3,1,4) would return 4 and it is the greatest one out of the numbers
- challenge
- restaurant of alisha!!!!
- super annoying

### what are my feelings
- mad at alisha for not doing her own work!!!!!!!
- why should i do all her work for her!!??

## 1/Mar/2025 26th Day:

### what we learned today?
- **Khanacademy**
  - compound loops
  - loop conditions with and
    - a loop with the and  operator only repeats while both conditions are True
    - it will terminate if at least one condition is False
    - e.g
      - while rina == happy and dad == happy:
      - in this loop, it will only excute when both cases are true
      - p.s
        - i know that this is not a proper code but it helps me understand better
  - loop conditions with or
    - a loop with the or operator will repeat if at least one of the conditions evaluates to True regardless of what the other condition is
    - for the loop to terminate, both of the conditions must evaluate to False
    - e.g
      - while rina == happy of dad == happy:
      - this loop will only stop if both rina and dad are not happy
  - break
    - when you put a break in, it jumps straight to the next line of code outside of the loop
  - continue
    - when you put a continue in, it jumps straight back to the start of the loop

    - a list in computing is a collection of items stored in a specific order.
    - lists can hold various data types, like numbers and strings.
    - they are useful for organising and managing data.
    - E.G
    - shopping_list = ["milk", "Eggs", "Flour", "Bread“, 2, "pens"]
    - print(shopping_list[3])
    - shoppin_list[4] = "🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐🥐"

### what we learned today?
- **Khanacademy**
  - List iteration
    - convention
      - convention is a common habit or rule that programers agree to follow, even though the computer doesn't require it.
      - it helps everyone read and understand code more easily
      - for example
        - index => i
    - for each loops
      - symbols = [1, 2, 3, 4]
      - for symbol in symbols:
         print(symbol)
    - for loops
      - symbols = [1, 2, 3, 4]
      - for i in range(len(symbols)):
         print(symbols[i])
    - in operator
      - the in operator checks if a value is inside a list
      - if it is, it will evaluate to true, if not the false
      - e.g "september" in birthdays

### what we learned today?
- **Khanacademy**
  - strings as lists
    - Immutable
      - immutable means it cannot be changed
      - so once you make a string, you can't change it's letters
      - if you want a new string, you have to make a whole new one
    - canonical form
      - canonical form means changing a string to a standard way so it's easy to compare
    - parsing
      - parsing means to breack down a string to small parts to get useful data
    - dot syntax
      - dot syntax means calling a method derictly on an object using a dot
      - e.g. "hello".upper()
    - **Methods**
      - lower()
        - the lower method returns a new string where all the letters are converted to lower case
      - upper()
        - the upper method returns a new string where all the letters are converted to upper case
      - strip()
        - the strip method removes any leadinf or trailing characters from a string
        - it is usualy whitespaces by defalt
        - however, it does not take away everthing
      - CSV
        - it stands for: comma-seperated values
        - it's a file format where each line represents a row of data, and each value in the row is separated by a comma
      - split()
        - the split method divides a string into a list of substrings base on a separator
      - join()
        - the join method is the opposite of the split method
        - the join method combines a list of strings into a single string inserting a seperater between each element
      - count()
        - the count method tells you how many times a certain character or word appear ina string
      - index()
        - the index method is where a character or word first show up in a string
      - isdigit()
        - the isdigit method checks if all the characters in a string are numbers
        - if they are, it gives True, if not, then false

  - List methods
    - .insert() method
      - the .insert() method add an element at a specific index. the first argument is the index and the second argument is the element
      - e.g. months.insert(2, "march")
    - .pop() method
      - the .pop() method takes away the last element of a list
      - deleted_element = months.pop()
      - unlike the previous list methods, pop returns the value
      - if you want to delete a specific index => pop(1)
    - .remove() method
      - the remove method deletes the first element that matches a specific value
      - e,g, months.remove("Feb")
      - if multiple values match, it deletes the first one.
      - if there are none, then it is a ValueError.
      - it does not return a value

## 29/june/2025 47th day:

### what we learned today?
- **Khanacademy**
  - dictionary methods
    - dictionaries also use dot syntax
    - .get() method
      - the .get() mehod retrieves the value of the key you put.
      - if that key doesn't exist, it will return none
      - however, we can specify a different default value by passing in a second value
      - e.g. font_sizes = settings.get("coulor", "black")
      - this will return "black" as there isn't a key called colour in our dictionary
    - .pop() method
      - the .pop() method deletes the item associated with a specific key and returns its value
      - if no key matches, we get a key error
      - to prevent this, we can specify a default value to return
      - e.g. line_spacing = settings.pop("spacing", 1)
      - our dictionary doesn't have the key "spacing" so it returns the specified value of 1
    - .update() method
      - the .update() method defines a strategy for merging dictionaries.
      - if both deictionaries have and item with the same key, it uses the value from the second dictionary
      - e.g. settings.update({"spacing":2, "style":"bold"})
      - this updates the original dictionary settings in place
      - since both dictionaries have the key "style", the value "bold" will replace the value "italic" becasue it is from the second dictionary
    - dicitonary
      - .value()
      - .item()
      - .key()
    - BY KEY:
      - for word in wotd_counts:
            print(word)
    - BY VALUE:
      - for count in word_count.values:
            print(count)
    - BY ITEM
      - for word, count in word_count,items():
            print(word)
            print(count)
